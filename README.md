# Bayesian averaging of computer models with domain discrepancies: a nuclear physics perspective - Instruction to supplementary code

This repository contains complete Python code to reproduce the examples in "Bayesian averaging of computer models with domain discrepancies: a nuclear physics perspective."

## The source code for examples:
1. [A Pedagogical Example - no domanin correction](Pedagogical_example_simple.py)
2. [A Pedagogical Example - with domain correction](Pedagogical_example_domain_correction.py)
3. [Averaging nuclear (mass) models](Application_averaging_of_nuclear_mass_models.py)
4. [Averaging nuclear mass emulators in the Ca region](Application_nuclear_mass_emulators_CA_region.py)
5. [WS potential](WS_potential.py)

## Notes
- Each of the examples above is self sufficient.
- The **.py** files start with a list of packages to be loaded, followed by function definitions.
- The main body of each of the examples starts with section that loads the already computed results and reproduces charts and tables in the paper
- The main body that contains all the analysis is denoted in each of the example source files.
- All the files in the repository that are not **.py** files are either datasets or pre-computed results.
